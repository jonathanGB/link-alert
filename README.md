Chrome extension that allows users to get notification on links that would send them to unwanted content.

The back-end repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonathanGB/link-alert-backend">here</a> : the back-end gets the URLs that our extension wants to check, and returns to the extension all the base URLs, so it bypasses tricks with redirecting URLs.
